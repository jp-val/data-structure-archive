# data-structure-archive

## Implemented in C
(b/c these data structures are already implemented in Java and C++)

	- Linked List
	- Heap (can be initialized to be either a Min or Max Heap)
	- Hash Table (with Quadradic Probing Collision Resolution)
	- Hash Map (with Linked Chaining Collision Resolution)

## Implemented in Java
(using OOP)

	- Binary Search Tree
	- Trie
	- Treap
	- Disjoint Set
	- Bloom Filter Version 1: Using Boolean Arrays
	- Bloom Filter Version 2: Using BigInteger and Bitwise Operators
	- Graph (not a great feat, but I coded it up to use in a few algorithms)

**TODO**

	- AVL Tree
